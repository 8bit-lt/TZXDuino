# TZXDuino

TZX and TAP (currently only ZX spectrum flavour) file player written for Arduino.

Parts Used:
  Arduino (I used a Nano, but this should work on any NANO compatible)
  SD card module
  16x2 I2C LCD
  Small audio amp, I used an LM386 module, but any headphone type amp should work
  5 x Buttons (micro switches are best, but any should work)
