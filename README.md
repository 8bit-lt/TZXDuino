#TZXDuino

TZX and TAP (currently only ZX spectrum flavour) file player written for Arduino.

## Parts Used
1. Arduino (I used a Nano, but this should work on any NANO compatible)
2. SD card module
3. 16x2 I2C LCD
4. Small audio amp, I used an LM386 module, but any headphone type amp should work
5. 5 x Buttons (micro switches are best, but any should work)

## Installation

## History
Starting with the Arduitape WAV playing project, i've moved to playing file directly without needing to convert them to a WAV file first.
